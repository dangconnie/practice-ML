# Beginner's Code and Notes on Data Analysis

#### Most of my notes are usually within the code
1. introToMLiris.pynb - Machine Learning
    **Purpose:** Getting iris dataset from a website, exploratory analysis, build model, use that model to make predictions

    **Skills:** 
    *Pandas-* Library with tons of data analysis tools
    *Matplotlib.pyplot-* Used for plotting data
    *K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)*
    *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*
    *Jupyter Notebook*
